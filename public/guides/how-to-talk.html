    <h1>How to Talk to AI</h1>
    <p>How to better interact with the AI Mental Health Companion:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Express your emotions and concerns directly. The AI will listen patiently.</li>
      <li>Try to describe your specific situation for more targeted advice.</li>
      <li>No need to worry about privacy‚Äîall conversations are anonymous.</li>
      <li>In emergencies, please seek real human help promptly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why Choose AI Conversation?</h2>
    <p>The AI Mental Health Companion is available 24/7, anonymous, and non-judgmental, providing us with a platform to
      safely express our feelings. It's often quicker and more free than waiting for others to respond.</p>

    <h2>Five Tips for Efficient AI Conversation</h2>

    <h3>1. üí¨ Start with Specific Emotion Description</h3>
    <p>Instead of just saying "I'm not okay," you can try saying: "I was criticized at work today and feelÂßîÂ±à and angry."
      Specific emotion descriptions help the AI to respond more accurately to your feelings.</p>

    <h3>2. üß≠ Set a Small Talk Goal</h3>
    <p>For example: "Today I want to get things off my chest"; or "I want to practice expressing my vulnerable
      feelings." Talking with a goal gives direction.</p>

    <h3>3. üìù Use Conversation to Self-Reflect</h3>
    <p>While talking, observe your emotional changes. Often, talking is itself a form of thought organization.</p>

    <h3>4. ü§ñ Use Guiding Questions</h3>
    <p>If you don't know how to start, you can directly tell the AI: "I want to talk about something difficult
      recently." or: "Can you help meÊ¢≥ÁêÜ‰∏Ä‰∏ãÊàëÁé∞Âú®Ê∑∑‰π±ÁöÑÊÉÖÁª™ÂêóÔºü"</p>

    <h3>5. üå± End with Self-Appreciation</h3>
    <p>After each conversation, you can say: "Thanks to myself for being willing to open up today." Every
      self-encouragement is a step towards healing.</p>

    <h2>Real Experience Sharing</h2>
    <p>Xiaoyue often opens the AI Mental Health Companion at night when she encounters difficult emotions. She found
      that even just typing to vent, she could calm down and gradually clarify her confused thoughts, and the next day's
      self was more powerful to face life.</p>

    <h2>Advice for Those Exploring Conversation</h2>
    <p>Conversation itself is a self-hug. No matter how many words you say, no matter if you cry or laugh out loud,
      please believe: every time you open up, you're gently approaching yourself.</p>
