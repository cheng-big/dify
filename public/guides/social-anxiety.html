    <h2>Understanding Social Anxiety</h2>
    <p>Social anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental health challenges. It can make you feel extremely
      uneasy, fearful, or embarrassed when facing judgment, speaking in public, or even during simple social
      interactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Social anxiety is not a weakness or intentional avoidance. It is a valid emotional
      state that can be understood and improved step by step.</p>
    <h2>Five Gentle Practices to Ease Social Anxiety</h2>
    <h3>1. üí¨ Accept Your Current State</h3>
    <p>Remind yourself: "It's normal to feel nervous right now." Accepting your anxiety can actually help it fade over
      time.</p>
    <h3>2. üö∂ Start with Small Scenarios</h3>
    <p>You don't have to challenge big gatherings at first. Try greeting a cashier or smiling at a coworker each day.
    </p>
    <h3>3. üßò Practice Relaxation Techniques</h3>
    <p>Before social events, do 3-5 minutes of deep breathing or mindfulness exercises to help your body relax.</p>
    <h3>4. ü§ñ Simulate Social Situations with AI</h3>
    <p>Use the AI Mental Health Companion to practice simple social conversations, like "How to start a conversation
      naturally," to reduce fear in real-life situations.</p>
    <h3>5. üå± Record Every Small Act of Bravery</h3>
    <p>Write down your small social attempts each day, no matter how minor. Accumulating positive experiences is key to
      overcoming social anxiety.</p>
    <h2>Real Story Resonance</h2>
    <p>During college, Alex often avoided group gatherings due to social anxiety. By practicing conversations with the
      AI Mental Health Companion‚Äîstarting with a simple "hello"‚Äîhe gradually opened up. Two years later, he could
      confidently participate in speech contests. Although he still felt nervous inside, he learned to coexist
      peacefully with his anxiety.</p>
    <h2>For Those Who Are Trying</h2>
    <p>Social anxiety doesn't disappear overnight. But every attempt is a step toward reconnecting with yourself and the
      world. Trust that gentle change is happening, little by little.</p>
