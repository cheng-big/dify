    <h1>Social Anxiety Self-Help Guide</h1>
    <p>Social anxiety is more common than you think. If you feel nervous or uncomfortable in social situations, you are
      not alone. Here are some practical tips to help you manage social anxiety and build your confidence:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Set achievable social goals, like saying hello to a neighbor or making small
        talk with a colleague.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Self-Compassion:</strong> Be kind to yourself. It's okay to feel anxious—acknowledge your
        feelings without judgment.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare and Rehearse:</strong> Think about what you want to say in advance. Practice common social
        scenarios to feel more comfortable.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on Others:</strong> Shift your attention from your own anxiety to the people you are interacting
        with. Listen actively and ask questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenge Negative Thoughts:</strong> Notice and question self-critical or catastrophic thinking.
        Replace them with more realistic, positive thoughts.</li>
      <li><strong>Seek Support:</strong> Talk to friends, family, or a mental health professional. You can also use AI
        Mental Health Companion for anonymous support and practice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember, progress takes time. Celebrate your small victories and be patient with yourself as you grow more
      confident in social situations.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Social Anxiety</h2>
    <p>Social anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental health challenges. It can make you feel extremely
      uneasy, fearful, or embarrassed when facing judgment, speaking in public, or even during simple social
      interactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Social anxiety is not a weakness or intentional avoidance. It is a valid emotional
      state that can be understood and improved step by step.</p>

    <h2>Five Gentle Practices to Ease Social Anxiety</h2>

    <h3>1. 💬 Accept Your Current State</h3>
    <p>Remind yourself: "It's normal to feel nervous right now." Accepting your anxiety can actually help it fade over
      time.</p>

    <h3>2. 🚶 Start with Small Scenarios</h3>
    <p>You don't have to challenge big gatherings at first. Try greeting a cashier or smiling at a coworker each day.
    </p>

    <h3>3. 🧘 Practice Relaxation Techniques</h3>
    <p>Before social events, do 3-5 minutes of deep breathing or mindfulness exercises to help your body relax.</p>

    <h3>4. 🤖 Simulate Social Situations with AI</h3>
    <p>Use the AI Mental Health Companion to practice simple social conversations, like "How to start a conversation
      naturally," to reduce fear in real-life situations.</p>

    <h3>5. 🌱 Record Every Small Act of Bravery</h3>
    <p>Write down your small social attempts each day, no matter how minor. Accumulating positive experiences is key to
      overcoming social anxiety.</p>

    <h2>Real Story Resonance</h2>
    <p>During college, Alex often avoided group gatherings due to social anxiety. By practicing conversations with the
      AI Mental Health Companion—starting with a simple "hello"—he gradually opened up. Two years later, he could
      confidently participate in speech contests. Although he still felt nervous inside, he learned to coexist
      peacefully with his anxiety.</p>

    <h2>For Those Who Are Trying</h2>
    <p>Social anxiety doesn't disappear overnight. But every attempt is a step toward reconnecting with yourself and the
      world. Trust that gentle change is happening, little by little.</p>
